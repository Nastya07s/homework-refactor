# Task

Refactor ```getDataLinkWidgetsChain``` function in ```hw-refactoring-code.ts``` file.

Refactored code should pass tests. Test execution via ```npm test```.

Refactoring might include any actions which you'd like:

* Files decomposition
* Namings change
* Comments
* Algorithm change
* Function decomposition
* Libraries removal
* Patterns change
* Overall test execution approach (but not test data itself and test criterias)

Anything what you think would be better and simplify the code. 

You are not limited in instruments or actions, so try to make as best as you think you can.
